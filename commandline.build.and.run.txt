
By default it requires a PostgreSQL db (source code has other working examples of mysql)
This is picked up from a DATABASE_URL env variable such as

	postgresql://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb

To switch to MySQL change src/main/WEB-INF/classes/default.datasource-context.xml 
to refer to the other properties file. If you get the code working with other 
databases let me know the settings which worked and I will commit them 
for other folks. 

Linux/Mac

1) Obtain the maven3 tar.gz and extract into a folder such as /home/simon/maven
2) Checkout the sourcecode from GitHub
	git clone https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
3) cd ZkToDo2
4) Setup the environment variables for maven and the jdk and ensure that their bin
folders are on your path (see stackoverflow.com for where your JAVA_HOME will be)
	MAVEN_HOME=/home/simon/maven
	export MAVEN_HOME
	JAVA_HOME=/home/simon/jdk1.6
	export JAVA_HOME
	PATH=$JAVA_HOME\bin:$MAVEN_HOME\bin:$PATH
	DATABASE_URL=postgresql://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb
	export DATABASE_URL
5) Run it
	mvn -Djetty.port=8080 package jetty:run

Windows: 

1) Download an apache Maven zip file from http://maven.apache.org/
and extract into a folder that does not have spaces in the path 
e.g. C:\users\simon\apache\maven
2) Checkout the sourcecode from GitHub
	git clone https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
it is a good idea to check the code out into a folder that does not have
spaces e.g. C:\users\simon\projects\zktodo2
3) Open up a command shell (cmd.exe) either from Start > Run... > cmd.exe
on XP or by searching for cmd on the start menu of Vista/WinowsWhatever.
4) Change directories into the folder where the pom.xml file was checked 
out from Subversion e.g. cd C:\users\simon\projects\zktodo2
5) Within the cmd.exe configure the location of your jdk1.5 or above with
	set JAVA_HOME=C:\users\simon\jdk1.5
6) With the cmd.exe configure the location of your maven install
	set MAVEN_HOME=C:\users\simon\apache\maven
7) Ensure that both the java.exe and the mvn.bat folders are on your 
binary PATH with the command
	set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
8) Ensure that it knows the database connection details
	set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb
9) Compile and run the jetty webcontainer with the maven command
	mvn -Djetty.port=8080 clean install jetty:run
jetty will stay running on port until you kill it by entering Ctrl+c
