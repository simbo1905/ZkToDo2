
By default it requires a PostgreSQL db (source code has other working examples of mysql)
This is picked up from a DATABASE_URL env variable such as

	postgres://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb

To switch to MySQL change src/main/WEB-INF/classes/default.datasource-context.xml 
to refer to the other properties file. If you get the code working with other 
databases let me know the settings which worked and I will commit them 
for other folks. 

Linux/Mac

1) Obtain the maven3 tar.gz and extract into a folder such as /home/simon/maven
2) Checkout the sourcecode from GitHub
	git clone https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
3) cd ZkToDo2
4) Setup the environment variables for maven and the jdk and ensure that their bin
folders are on your path (see stackoverflow.com for where your JAVA_HOME will be)
	MAVEN_HOME=/home/simon/maven
	export MAVEN_HOME
	JAVA_HOME=/home/simon/jdk1.6
	export JAVA_HOME
	PATH=$JAVA_HOME\bin:$MAVEN_HOME\bin:$PATH
	DATABASE_URL=postgres://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb
	export DATABASE_URL
5) Run it
	mvn -Djetty.port=8080 package jetty:run

Windows: 

1) Download an apache Maven zip file from http://maven.apache.org/
and extract into a folder that does not have spaces in the path 
e.g. C:\users\simon\apache\maven
2) Checkout the sourcecode from GitHub
	git clone https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
it is a good idea to check the code out into a folder that doex not have
spaces e.g. C:\users\simon\projects\zktodo2
3) Open up a command shell (cmd.exe) either from Start > Run... > cmd.exe
on XP or by searching for cmd on the start menu of vista.
4) Change directories into the folder where the pom.xml file was checked 
out from Subversion e.g. cd C:\users\simon\projects\zktodo2
5) Within the cmd.exe configure the location of your jdk1.5 or above with
	set JAVA_HOME=C:\users\simon\jdk1.5
6) With the cmd.exe configure the location of your maven install
	set MAVEN_HOME=C:\users\simon\apache\maven
7) Ensure that both the java.exe and the mvn.bat folders are on your 
binary PATH with the command
	set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
8) Ensure that it knows the database connection details
	set DATABASE_URL=postgres://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb
9) Compile and run the jetty webcontainer with the maven command
	mvn -Djetty.port=8080 clean install jetty:run
jetty will stay running on port until you kill it by entering Ctrl+c
