Openshift Express Linux/Mac 

First: 

	Sign-up for Openshift Express and login to the web console. Add your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
	key as your SSH PUBLIC KEY on openshift which will allow you to push code

	Ensure that you can compile and run locally using the commmandline.build.and.run.txt
	to know that your maven build is all working fully functional. 

	Disclaimer: There are lots of steps here and so it is unlikely I can stay fully up to
	date when they upgrade things. See the footnotes for where to find their docs. In 
	short these steps worked for me once but your mileage may vary; use their community 
	documentation to troubleshoot. 

Install their toolbelt (their tools are ruby based):

	sudo apt-get install ruby-full
	sudo apt-get install rubygems1.8
	sudo gem install rhc
	
	#ensure that gems is on your PATH; look for EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY in following
	gem environment 
	#then ensure that PATH has that on it
	PATH=$PATH:/your/gems/path/bin
	export PATH

Create Domain, Application and Database

	Note this instructions create a new folder for your redhat cloud instance into which you will pull the demo 
	sourcecode. So whilst you should try commmandline.build.and.run.txt to ensure maven is setup correctly 
	you will need to work with a fresh folder to setup the server and will use git to pull the code into that folder

	# if you don't have one yet you need to create a domain on their cloud (pick your own name not 'zkdemo')
	rhc-create-domain -n zkdemo -l your@login.email -p 
	
	#setup the cloud app instance as DIY type (okay to set the app name to 'zktd2')
	rhc-create-app -a zktd2 -t diy-0.1 -p 
	
	# details can be confirmed with by logging into the openshift web console
	# your app is UUID@appname-namespace.rhcloud.com (e.g. 62f0ef4ab25b47de8702c9ed12bfdbaf@zktd2-zkdemo.rhcloud.com)
	# ensure you can login to your cloud instance with "ssh UUID@appname-namespace.rhcloud.com"
	# if you get permission denied add your local ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key 
	# as your SSH PUBLIC KEY on your openshift console (this required to push code to the server)
	
	# add a postregsql database to your instance
	# important! note down the details of your database including password, db, url (which has host ip) as output by this command
	rhc-ctl-app -a zktd2 -e add-postgresql-8.4 -l your@login.email
	
	#ssh to your cloud instance, connect to the database and run a test query, create the table (find the UUID on your web console and use your app-domain.rhcloud.com)
	ssh 62f0ef4ab25b47de8702c9ed12bfdbaf@zktd2-zkdemo.rhcloud.com
	# the password and ip to use were on the output of the create database command you ran as well as your database name
	PGPASSWORD=${OPENSHIFT_DB_PASSWORD} psql -h ${OPENSHIFT_DB_HOST} -U ${OPENSHIFT_DB_USERNAME} -d zktd2
	select 1 as a, 2 as b, 3 as c;
	CREATE TABLE reminder ( reminder_id bigint NOT NULL, date timestamp without time zone, name character varying(255), priority integer, CONSTRAINT reminder_pkey PRIMARY KEY (reminder_id ));
	\q
	exit
	
	# go into the server folder on your workstation and git pull in the demo source code into the server
	cd zktd2/
	# backup the readme file as it has interesting infomation about your app
	cp README ..
	#add the demo code repo to the folder
	git remote add upstream https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
	# in the next command just hit return if asked for a password for downloading the code
	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
	# you can check that 'upstream' points to my demo code and 'origin' points to your server with 
	git remote show upstream
	git remote show origin
	# insure the code build and deploys see commmandline.build.and.run.txt for full details
	mvn package
	#once you have it working push it up to 'origin' which should be your server which will build it
	git push
	#tail the logs in a second window
	rhc-tail-files -a zktd2 -l your@login.email
	
	Note: if your deployment does not go okay first time you may have to ssh into your server
	and use "ps -ef" to find the java and postgresql processes and "kill -9" them. Then touch 
	a source file and "git commit -a" followed by "git push" to rebuild and redeploy which 
	should restart the database process. If you run into issues use the redhat forums. 

Optional:

	# the console shows you the ssh url of your openshift server repository so you can add it a fresh clone of my code with
	git remote add openshift ssh://XXX@YY.rhcloud.com/~/git/ZZZZ.git/
	git push openshift master
	# search statckoverflow.com if you have git issues
	
	To get at the database using tools take a look at port forwarding:
	https://openshift.redhat.com/community/blogs/getting-started-with-port-forwarding-on-openshift

Most of their commands let you add "-p your_password". Note also that eclipse lets you create 
run command which are external scripts so you can no doubt set it up so that you can tail 
the server logs from inside of eclipse with an eclipse run. 

Foot Notes
==========

Openshift started out only supporting MySQL but now also support postgresql.  

There are some quickstart docs https://openshift.redhat.com/app/express#create_application

Yet the full docs are at http://docs.redhat.com/ so try google "site:http://docs.redhat.com/ rhc-create-app"

The instructions above do a source push (your code on their cloud) but you can also push only a WAR
using a completely different set of commands. 

End.
